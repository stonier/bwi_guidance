    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    Please read the instructions thoroughly before proceeding.
    <h4> Experiment Goal </h4>
    <ul> 
      <li>
        In these experiments, you'll be controlling a simulated person to find a 
        red ball located somewhere on the floor. Images of the
        simulated person and the ball are below. <br />
        <img height="200" src="images/person.png" /> <img height="100" src="images/ball.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
        The ball you are trying to locate may be in an open area where it is
        easy to see, or it might be inside a room and not easily
        visible from the outside through the doorway. Once you find
        the ball, run into it to proceed to the next experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your goal will be to find the ball as quickly as possible. At the end of 
        each experiment, you will receive a score based on how fast you were 
        able to locate the ball. Your score for that experiment will be added to
        your total.
      </li>
      <li>
        We'll being with a couple of tutorials to get you started. After that
        there will be 6 experiments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Robots </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There will be some robots in the environment that will try and help you
        reach the destination. These robots are pictured below: <br />
        <img height="150" src="images/robot.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
        The robots will always try and do their best to direct you along the 
        correct path to the goal. However, there might not be enough robots
        available in an experiment to make the path to the goal easy to follow.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you approach a robot, an arrow will pop up pointing you in the 
        right direction. If an arrow does not pop up, it means the robot is 
        there performing some other task, and you should ignore that robot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It will take you between 15-30 minutes to complete the entire set of
    experiments, so make sure you have enough time to proceed. <br/>
